# Welcome to my portfolio!
Here, you'll find the products from interests of mine that I think are worth sharing.
Photos, videos, digital designs, documentation from my Rubik's Cube course at Rice, niche Python scripts--it's all here in one place.
<br><br>
I hope you enjoy what you see as much as I did creating it!

# So... why is a medical student writing HTML/CSS?
9 times out of 10, I look more like a West Coast tech bro than a healthcare professional.
So, let me explain.

## March 2023
I was a part-time senior in my final semester at Rice University with too much time on my hands.
Making good progress on my extracurricular activities, I had already begun revisiting Python programming and LaTeX document preparation in the prior month.
The last time I coded was in middle school, when I wrote a Python script for a self-directed project in 8th grade English class.
Now, I thought I would challenge myself by jumping into front-end development--learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all together.
<br><br>
A good friend of mine from high school, also a pre-medical student with a knack for coding, built a barebones but interactive site on GitHub Pages allowing users to rank Marvel Cinematic Universe characters based on personal preference.
Having now seen the ease with which someone could write functional HTML/CSS/JS and host for free using GitHub, I got the idea to make an online quiz testing how well people in my church college ministry knew the members of my small group.
<br><br>
It took about a week of perusing Stack Overflow, writing code, and generating the necessary assets, to create this quiz, which was well-received by both my small group and the greater college ministry.
By then, I was needing to think more carefully about my future plans, with undergraduate commencement in just two months, zero medical school acceptances thus far, and a looming re-application process.
Feeling accomplished enough from working with five programming and markup languages (albeit at an introductory level) within a single semester without any formal computer science education, I rested from coding.

## January 2024
Thankfully, I received an acceptance to UT Southwestern Medical School two days before commencement.
Fast-forwarding several months, I finished the first semester of our basic science curriculum and began the first organ system block--the Musculoskeletal and Skin course.
Truth be told, I found dermatology to be overwhelmingly stale (no offense to any skin lovers/experts reading this--it's an important and necessary specialty).
<br><br>
Naturally, I began looking for other topics to occupy my mind, eventually landing back on front-end development.
As a long-time photographer, I was growing sick of the limitations of Instagram Stories and Highlights for posting my best shots.
At the same time, I felt that migrating to a different photo-sharing service such as Flickr or VSCO would be futile without a personal portfolio website to show to potential clients.
Despite possessing experience with WYSIWYG CMS, specifically Wix and Squarespace, I knew immediately that I wanted to design and code my portfolio from scratch so that it could most accurately represent my personal philosophies.
With a WYSIWYG CMS, the temptation to use an attractive but generic template would be too strong.
<br><br>
So, I fired VS Code back up for the first time in almost one year and got to work.
Over a few weeks of here-and-there coding, I put together a rudimentary page structure, added styling, and refined over and over.
The PHOTO page took by far the longest.
It would be the flagship page of my portfolio with an expandable scrolling gallery, the likes of which I had never coded before.
After finishing HOME, PHOTO, SPEEDSOLVING, CODE, and ABOUT, I paused to focus fully on my medical studies.
I did not anticipate booking paid shoots anytime soon, so publication of my portfolio website fell quickly down my list of priorities.

## June 2024
MS1 year ended and my only summer break of medical school began.
Sitting at home in Southern California and relaxing before my planned Taiwan trip, I remembered I had yet to publish my portfolio website.
Wrapping up the styling for a couple of pages, there was one thing missing.
I quickly added a new page, ROADMAP, listing the aspirations I had for this site.
Now reaching a progress point where I felt comfortable making my work public, I finally committed my changes, producing the site you see today.
